Please don't forget to start it. 😍️😍️😍️

### About Business: Board Game
Business is the game of buying and selling real estate. Snap up as many squares of land, utilities, and railroads.

The objective of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.

It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.
